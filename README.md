# jackledead_infected
## Mod Description
jackledead_infected overhauls the classic zombie experience. All regular undead are replaced with Infected - diseased, cannibalistic humans driven by an unstoppable rage. Animals can also be infected with this mysterious illness.

This mod removes supernatural elements. No portal storms, no magical loot, no giant bugs or nether-beings just you against hordes of Infected. Scavenge for supplies and face hard choices about what lengths you'll go to in order to survive.

The Infected mutate over time. Some wither away, while others become swifter, stronger, and more cunning. Keep your wits about you, as the environment transforms dramatically after a few months. New apex Infected may emerge to rule the streets.

Pay attention for clues about the origins and spread of the disease. Is there a cure? Will the millitary come back? Can humanity triumph and rebuild? Or will the Infection consume all?

## Lore Primer
<details><summary>Spoiler Warning</summary>

We should have seen it coming. WHO and the CDC warned us. The conspiracy theorists warned us. We didn't listen.

It started small - isolated cases of a new rabies strain. But it quickly spiraled out of control. 

Mysterious mercenaries invaded the USA and the disease arrived with them. The president issued a draft and declared martial law but it wasn't enough. Florida and Hawaii were the first to fall. Then Washington DC. Then Montreal.

The infected weren't just mad - they were cannibals, eating anything living or dead. First came the chaos as victims turned overnight. Then the inevitable societal collapse.

Though strangely some seemed less afflicted by the effects of the infection. Whether by genetic immunity or viral suppresant drugs, it didn't affect everyone equally.

Now, months later, you're one of the last untouched by the Infection, through immunity or luck. You've seen devolution and adaptation in the infected. Some wither and starve, while others become primal alphas. Does any semblance of civilization remain? Will you cling to your morality, or descend into savagery like the infected around you? How far are you willing to go to survive?
