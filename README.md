# jackledead_infected
## Mod Description
CDDA mod. Changes all classic zombies and runners and zombie animals to infected humans (Symbol "I", Color usually light_gray) and infected animals. They run fast and are weak, some faster or slower, stronger or weaker than others. Only spawn infected, robots and wildlife. Removes portal storms and non-classic map features. No more tainted meat from these guys, we eating human tonight. Infected starve over time, degrading evey few weeks, or they may come out on top as cannibal kings or fast crawlers.

## How to install (CDDA):
### 1. Click the green button in the top and download as a zip
### 2. Extract and then
### 3. simply put jackledead_infected/mods/jackledead_infected in your /data/mods/ folder

## How to install (CBN):
### 1. Click the green button in the top and download as a zip
### 2. Extract and then
### 3. simply put jackledead_infected/mods BN/jackledead_infected in your /data/mods/ folder
### 4. play with default monster evolution at 4.00 at world gen. twice what is default, 2. 
I will adjust monster half lives soon so you dont have to do this step. If you dont play with it at 4, and keep it at default of 2, then infected will starve twice as fast as intended.

## Suggested Tileset
#### ULTICA: Represent infected humans pretty closely to my vision with the zombie sprites in ULTICA.
#### ASCII/RETRODAYS: Simple means more imagination to fill your mind.
#### UNDEAD PEOPLE TILESET: [github.com/Theawesomeboophis/UndeadPeopleTileset](https://github.com/Theawesomeboophis/UndeadPeopleTileset) Looks great with the guns from jackledead armory, is very visible and fun. Great mods compatibility.
